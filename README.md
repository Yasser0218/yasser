Portfolio Optimization (Data analytics Course
Quantitative Risk Analysis and Portfolio Optimization Tool
#Overview
This project is a Python-based tool designed to perform quantitative risk analysis and portfolio optimization using modern financial techniques. It demonstrates my ability to handle financial data, apply quantitative methods, and create practical solutions for financial decision-making.

# Features
Data Collection:

Fetch historical stock prices using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).

Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, normalize data, etc.).

# Risk Analysis:

Calculate key risk metrics:

Value at Risk (VaR)

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

Portfolio Volatility

Visualize risk metrics using Matplotlib and Plotly.

# Portfolio Optimization:

Implement Markowitzâ€™s Mean-Variance Optimization to generate an efficient frontier.

Use the Black-Litterman model for advanced portfolio allocation.

Perform Monte Carlo simulations for risk-adjusted returns.

# Backtesting:

Simulate the performance of optimized portfolios over historical data.

Compare results against benchmarks like the S&P 500.

# User Interface:

Built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

Users can input stock tickers, adjust parameters, and view results.

# Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

yfinance: Fetching financial data.

NumPy, Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib, Plotly: Data visualization.

PyPortfolioOpt: Portfolio optimization.

Streamlit: Building the web interface.

Version Control: GitHub.
